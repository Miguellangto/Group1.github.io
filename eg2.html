              <strong>What types of broadcasting software can we use for our stream? (Miguel)</strong><br>
              For our research (The Ideal Choice of Public Transportation for APEC Marikina Students), we can use OBS Studio for online streaming. While apps like Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram provide basic live streaming options using a device’s camera and mic, OBS Studio allows advanced editing and live-streaming features. For mobile or tablet streaming, we can use Streamlabs. Conclusion: Facebook will be our platform, with OBS Studio as the software app.

                <li>Our goal in our stream is to educate and to entertain our target audience. (Apple)</li>
                <li>To serve as a source of inspiration for others who are considering starting their own streams or ideas that they have collected from viewing ours, our stream offers more than just informative content; it is also fun because we incorporate activities that our viewers will find enjoyable.</li>

              <strong>Differentiate the different ideate tools.</strong>
              <p>Although the tools of mind mapping, 5 whys, and fishbone diagram all lead to a conclusion to a problem, the main differences lie in their structure. Mind maps are more versatile and can have abundant connections, while fishbone diagrams are more organized and specific with the order of the problems, and 5 whys is the most efficient as most problems done with this method usually have the root identified at the 5th or 7th question. (Raibert)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Which tool was the most helpful to you during the activity?</strong>
              <p>The design thinking template was the most useful tool during the activity. It helped us fully understand the problem we wanted to tackle and taught us how to effectively connect with our audience by helping us brainstorm effective solutions. (Earl)</p>
